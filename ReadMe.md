M@gic - A tool written in Ironpython with the goal of achieving a low level of detection, and living within the land boundaries.
-------------------------------------
Currently it's under development
- Main Features:
* Run powershell commands by using system.management.automation within the windows dll and not the regular .net framwork dll
* Compile using msbuild without the need of msbuild.exe :) as it uses the functionality of the Microsoft.BuildEngine 
* Run WMI Builtin queries and your own by using their .NET objects with the help of system.management
